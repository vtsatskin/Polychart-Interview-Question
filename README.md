Mayank's Fork
===========================
Saw this on vtsatskin's github and wanted to fork for some chanegs,
made Euler's aglorithm into a recursive function,
changed step by 1000 to gallop search

Code not tested since i don't want to run JS, but logic should work



Polychart-Interview-Question
============================

Hello there Polychat Recruiter (or curious people browsing my code)!

First off, I would like to note I've never actually used Node.Js before, so
please pardon my ignorance of any subtle nuances of the framework I may have missed.

# Problem Statement:
"The goal of this challenge is to find the index of a given word in a dictionary.
The only way to interface with the dictionary is through a function `lookup(index)`,
which either returns the word at that index, or `false` if the index is out of
bounds. Words are represented as strings. The indices of the dictionary are a
contiguous set of non-negative integers starting with 0."

# Testing Procedure:
I verified this code is correct by manually testing cases. Not the best way,
I could have written some test cases, but that seemed a little bit of overkill.
